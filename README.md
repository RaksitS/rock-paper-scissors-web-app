## ﻿My First Interactive Web Game: Rock Paper Scissors
I built this project to move beyond from static pages and practice how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create a functional user experience.

## What I learned from this practice project are:
- DOM Manipulation: I learned how to use JavaScript to link with my HTML to update scores and game results on the screen without refreshing the page.
- Layout Basics: Used CSS Flexbox to make sure the game looks clean and centered on different screen sizes.
- Game Logic & State: Developed a logic system in JavaSript to track scores, count rounds, and handle win/loss conditions.
- Event Listeners: Implemented button clicks to trigger game functions for interactive game.

## Built With:
- HTML5 (Structure)
- CSS3 (Styling & Layout)
- Vanilla JavaScript (Game Logic & DOM updates)
